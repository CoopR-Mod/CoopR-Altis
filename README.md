# What is CoopR?
The abbreviation CoopR resolves into Coop Roleplay. These two keywords are leading the whole idea of this modification. CoopR Mod is a gameplay overhaul. Combining coop gameplay with interesting yet not immersion-killing roleplay game elements.
CoopR will come in two different release systems. The first to be published is the CoopR Light coop gameplay enhancement. It can be described as a subset of features that passed quality assurance by bringing proper gameplay enhancements that do not have any dependency to other addons of the CoopR Mod ecosystem. The other release is the CMF (CoopR Mission Framework). This framework will provide a library of editor modules and scenario attributes to create multiplayer missions that redefine ArmA3 gameplay by a large package of new immersive features. Additionally the integration of popular modifications like ALiVE and ACE3 will push the feature list even further. The CMF will be officially implemented by CoopR and is planned to run on multiple game servers. The collection of those servers is defined under the CoopR Combat Theatre term. A “theatre” defines the lore multiple servers are running under. Technically players can transfer their characters and squads only between servers where the threatre is the same. There is no way of transfering a World War 2 threatre character into a NATO war theatre. 

# CoopR Light
CoopR Light’s primary goal is to extend the gameplay of coop multiplayer squads. It is a small subset of the whole CoopR mod idea. When the development of CoopR Mod started it was clear that this modification will take at least two years to implement all planned features. As time went by the amount of feature ideas grew and therefore the release date was pushed back further into the unknown future.
To this date the CoopR team managed to develop a working base with a good amount of core features. We realized that there is a basic feature set ready to be released. We call this set the “CoopR Light” release. The reason to release this light version is to a community testing a released state of the modification. We expect to receive hands-on feedback and suggestions that help adjusting the development process. Reported bugs will be brought into the development of CoopR and fixed in future releases.
The following conditions need to be met so an addon is a candidate to be released in the CoopR Light release:
No dependencies to other Non-Light addons
Adds striking enhancement of coop gameplay 
Will not require a wipe of any persistence data

# CoopR Mission Framework
The CMF (CoopR Mission Framework) will provide a vast variety of editor placed modules, scenario attribute configurations mission configurations. The CMF will also offer a library of script functions to publish an API for other addons or mods. This is what the framework will bring to the customization point of view. With CMF you can build a completly new type of coop missions. One core feature is the RPG addon. It allows players to create characters with perks and role specifications. These characters are persisted and accessible between different mission created by the CMF. This bring another gameplay addition to coop missions - progress. Characters can increase their skills and “farm” their equipment. Incapacitation is not a trivial thing anymore. You can lose access to your character for a long time or even lose him completely due to permadeath situations. But the RPG system is not at all the only thing coming with the CMF. 
To shorten it up here is a short list of features that are either nearly completed or work in progress:

Character RPG System 
Local Persistence
Perk System 
Role Skill System 
Temporary Camp / Shelter System 
Supply Request System
Personal Storage / Barrack System
Recon Mission System
CoopR Webapp / Mobile-App Character Management
Extended Squad System
many more in concept...
